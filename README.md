What makes Americans of different political parties different?

The purpose of this project was to uncover potential differences between political parties in America. This was done by answering the following questions.

1. What are the demographic differences between Americans of various political parties? 
2. Do Americans across the political spectrum consume news information differently? 
3. Do Americans across the political spectrum have differing views on society or religion?

Feel free to read the report in either the .docx or .pdf formats. 

All the code from the project is saved in 3 seperate .ipynb files, one dedicated to each of the questions above.
